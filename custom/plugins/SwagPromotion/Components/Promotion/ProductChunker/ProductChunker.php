     * Chunk a given list of products.

     * chunk([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 3) => [[g1], [g2], [g3]]
     *
     * In this case each group will contain 3 products from the input array, e.g. [1, 2, 3]. The actual order depends
     * on the implementation of the chunker, as the first $amount items will be the ones, that defines the discount later on.
     * For this reason, the CheapestPriceChunker could return something like this:
     *
     * chunk([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 3, 1)         => [[0,8,7], [1,6,5], [2,4,3]]
     * chunk([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], 4, 2) => [[0,1,11,10], [2,3,9,8], [4,5,7,6]]
     *
     * In that case, the CheapestPriceChunker defines the ORDER of the items (cheapest prices first), the separation
     * of the items ($amount very cheap products at the beginning of any chunk) is performed by the AbstractProductChunker,
     * which could therefore be reuse for e.g. a "HighestPriceChunker" or a "ShippingCostChunker" etc.
